# Lab Report 5
## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario
### 1. The Original Post
Help! For Lab 3, I made a `test.sh` bash script like we did in class,
and it was working on my computer, but it's not working on the `ieng6` machine.
I used GitHub and `git status` to make sure the version on my computer and the one
on the `ieng6` machine are the same!

I thought it was because I had the wrong path, but as you can see, it's still not working
even after I added `lab3/`. Is there a difference between the computers?
Is this `ieng6` bugged too??

### 2. The Response
This `ieng6` machine does not have an issue with `javac`. Perhaps try looking carefully at
the command prompt, for when you run it on the two different devices.
It may also help if you shared your `test.sh` script!

### 3. A Clear Description
My `test.sh` file is as follows:
```
set -e
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore $1
```
On my computer, I open it in VS Code, and run the follow command:
```
RY-MacBook:lab3 Ruoya$ bash test.sh ArrayTests
JUnit version 4.13.2
........
Time: 0.009

OK (8 tests)

```
Whereas after `ssh`-ing into the `ieng6` machine, I attempt the following commands, and
get the following errors:
```
[r5yan@ieng6-201]:~:223$ bash test.sh ArrayTests
bash: test.sh: No such file or directory
[r5yan@ieng6-201]:~:224$ bash lab3/test.sh ArrayTests
javac: file not found: *.java
Usage: javac <options> <source files>
use -help for a list of possible options
[r5yan@ieng6-201]:~:225$ bash lab3/test.sh lab3/ArrayTests
javac: file not found: *.java
Usage: javac <options> <source files>
use -help for a list of possible options
```
I see from the command prompts that on my computer, I ran it from the `lab3` directory, 
but I ran it from the home directory in `ieng6`. I guess bash scripts run from the directory
they're started in, rather than the directory the script is in! The 2nd line of my `test.sh` 
thus fails, as it does not see the `lab3/` parts of the command. There's no `.java` files
in my home directory of `ieng6`, so that would explain why bash could not expand `*.java`.

### 4. Denouement
* In both cases, there is a `lab3` directory containing `test.sh`, `ArrayExamples.java`,
  `ArrayTests.java`, and the `lib` directory containing the necessary jar files.
* The `test.sh` file is shown above (Part 1.3). The contents of `ArrayExamples.java` and
  `ArrayTests.java` are not salient to this bug, but can be found at https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/lab3
  if desired.
* The lines `bash test.sh ArrayTests`, `bash lab3/test.sh ArrayTests`, and
  `bash lab3/test.sh lab3/ArrayTests` all do not work as intended, from the home directory.
* One could simply run `cd lab3` prior to running the tests, or modify the bash script to
  always run from where the script file is located:
```
set -e
cd $(dirname $0)
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore $1
```
This makes `bash lab3/test.sh ArrayTests` work
(source: https://ioflood.com/blog/bash-get-script-directory/).

## Part 2 - Reflection
Learning `ctrl-r` for searching bash history will save me a lot of time. For instance, 
my default ieng6 machine is bugged, and `ctrl-r` means I do not have to remember the whole
`ssh r5yan@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu` spiel, or use excessive up-arrowing. 

I also randomly discovered if you have an image on your clipboard (say via `cmd-ctrl-shift-4`
on Mac), pasting into GitHub's
markdown editor automatically uploads the image and inserts its corresponding `<img>` 
element, which is very convenient.
