# Lab Report 1
## 1. cd
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
```
The working directory was `/home`. With no argument, `cd` does not change directory, and does not
output anything.
This is not an error.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1/
```
The working directory was `/home`. This command changed the working directory to `/home/lecture1`, 
and the next prompt has changed to `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$`, accordingly. No output.
This is not an error.
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd README 
bash: cd: README: Not a directory
```
The working directory was `/home/lecture1`. The `cd` command expects a path to a directory, but was
given a path to a file, and thus spat out an error.
This is an error because a non-directory was given to `cd`, as explained in the error message.

## 2. ls
```
[user@sahara ~]$ ls
lecture1
```
The working directory was `/home`. With no argument, `ls` listed the files/folders in the working 
directory, which was just `lecture1`. This is not an error.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ ls lecture1/
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
```
The working directory was `/home`. The relative path in the argument led `ls` to list
the files/folders inside `lecture1`. 
This is not an error.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ ls lecture1/README 
lecture1/README
```
The working directory was `/home`. According to `man ls`, an argument leading to the file just prints
the file name, which is what we see here.
This is thus not an error.

## 3. cat
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cat
asdfasdflkj
asdfasdflkj
hi
hi
echo    
echo
^C
```
The working directory was `/home`. With no argument, `cat` read from the command line (standard input),
and printed (via standard output) whatever I typed, whenever I'd press enter. 
This is as expected from `man cat`; it is not an error.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cat lecture1/
cat: lecture1/: Is a directory
```
The working directory was `/home`. The `cat` command expects a path to a file, but was
given a path to a directory, and thus spat out an error.
This is an error because a non-file was given to `cat`, as explained in the error message.
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cat lecture1/README
To use this program:

javac Hello.java
java Hello messages/en-us.txt
```
The working directory was `/home`. The `cat` command printed the 4 lines saved within the file.
This is not an error.
