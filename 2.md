* The `handleRequest` method was called (not the `main` method, which is only called when we start the server).
* The `url` argument was a `URI` object, such that `url.getPath()` would return `/add-message` and `url.getQuery()` would return `s=hi guys&user=bob`. The `chatLog` field had the value of an empty String.
* After the string manipulation, the `chatLog` field changed to the value `bob: hi guys\n`.

## Part 3
From the `man` page of `mkdir`, I have discovered the `-p` option that allows you to create a nested sequence of directories by filling in the ones that do not exist yet. At first, I tested this with `mkdir delete/me -p`, and then I learned two things at once.
 1. Options must go before the operands.
 2. `mkdir` can create multiple directories at once, even if the an earlier one errors, or the directory name starts with an hyphen.
