# Lab Report 4
## Step 4

Keys pressed: `<ctrl-r>ssh<enter>`.

The `ssh r5yan@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu` was somewhere in my bash history 
(presumably, the last time I ran a command that started with `ssh`),
so I used Ctrl-R to search it up, then when I saw it, I pressed Enter to run it.

## Step 4.5
<img width="553" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156246456/7a778081-11b0-4a2d-87c5-5b83ace2ab56">

Keys pressed: `<ctrl-r>g<enter>`, then `rm -rf l<tab><enter>`.

Whoops! Looks like I still have a copy of this repository on the ieng6 machine.

Using Ctrl-R, I managed to get `git clone git@github.com:RuoyaUCSD/lab7.git`
from just typing `g`, so I saw it and pressed Enter to run it. The error indicates
I already have a `lab7` folder in my present directory, so I deleted it with
`rm -rf`, using Tab completion to speed things up slightly.

## Step 5
<img width="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156246456/4a7dd251-5e7f-4950-aa98-ecb8809164ce">

Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>`.

As you can see, I ran this command two commands ago, so I could use the "up"
arrow twice to run it again.

## Step 6
<img width="564" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156246456/d391fc39-c3cf-47e4-a7ed-d350dceddc48">

Keys pressed: `cd l<tab><enter>`, then `bash t<tab><enter>`.

Since `lab7` is the only file/directory in my present (home) directory that starts
with `l`, I could use Tab completion to access it. Similarly, `test.sh` is the
only file in `lab7` that starts with a `t`, so I used Tab completion to get it
to run with the `bash` command.

## Step 7
<img width="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156246456/e9ff2483-36ee-4af1-aed5-12129365989e">

Keys pressed: `vim <shift-l><tab>.<tab><enter>`, then `r2`, then `<shift-semicolon>wq<enter>`.

Since both `ListExamples.java` and `ListExamplesTests.java` starts with an `L`,
Tab completion only gave me the shared prefix `ListExamples`. By typing a `.`, 
I could use Tab completion again to get `ListExamples.java`.

This is where things get weird. I was ready to type `44G` then `e` to go to
the right cursor position, but apparently `vim` remembered where I was last 
time, despite this being a fresh copy of the same file in a fresh copy of the same
directory? So I just used `r2` to replace the 1 with a 2, and ran `:wq` to
save and quit.

## Step 8
<img width="396" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156246456/9244c9bf-37a7-4b82-bce0-c493d501157c">
Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>`.

Once again, the desired command was two commands ago, so I used "up" arrow
twice to run it again.

## Step 9
<img width="505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/RuoyaUCSD/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/156246456/7443c5ad-f677-4435-833f-0af5c4ab36b3">

Keys pressed: `git commit -a -m "Fix ListExamples"<enter>`, then `<ctrl-r>git p<enter>`.

I couldn't find `git commit` in my bash history using Ctrl-R for some reason,
so I used `<esc>` and `<ctrl-u>` to delete what I had, then manually typed
in the command. Note the `-a` option takes the place of `git add`.
I used Ctrl-R to get `git push` from my history, and pushed the commit.
